  <p>The following Essay, hastily prepared, and&mdash;though some
time has elapsed since its composition&mdash;now hastily corrected
for the press, was successful during the year 1836 in gaining
an honorary premium, established by <span class="smcap">William Taylor
Copeland</span>,  <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, M.&nbsp;P., during the year of his Mayoralty.</p>

  <p>The writer regrets that pressing avocations prevent his
devoting to his subject that application and research which
alone could make his composition more worthy of the name
of the amiable and highly esteemed founder of the Honorary
Premium, or of the approbation of the public.</p>

  <p>The writer desires further to express his obligations to
George William Johnson,  <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, of Gray’s Inn, Barrister at
Law, without whose kind assistance he would have been
unable to consult several of the Historical works which have
added materially to the information which he has collected
upon this subject.</p>

  <p class="no_indent">The attention of the student is so universally directed in
modern days to the attainment of Classic Literature, and
to the knowledge of that period of History which has
been stamped at once as the age of the purest taste and of
the highest philosophy, that the youth of our country are
too generally in entire ignorance of the early history of
their own race; and with few, with very few, exceptions
know no more than the names of those who in the
“dark ages,” as they are erroneously termed, exercised
an important influence over the well-being of England.</p>

  <p>All error is prolific in its offspring&mdash;the stigma of
darkness which has been passed upon the period that
elapsed between the fourth and the tenth centuries has
caused them if not actually to be shunned, at least to be
lightly esteemed in the course of study; and the useful
lessons to be acquired from the conduct of men in all but
a state of nature, have been neglected for the sake of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
those to be deduced from society as it has conventionally
existed in a highly civilized state. It is not here intended
to be denied but that much may be learned by this
method of procedure; yet is it unhesitatingly advanced
as a necessary axiom in polity, that the state of nature
should be <em>first</em> regarded, and the different improvements
upon, or at least alterations from, that state afterwards
compared, for the purpose of introducing a still higher
degree of amelioration. In no condition can the natural
propensities of man be learned so readily as in a natural
condition; and the more civilization has increased in any
country, so much the more difficult will it be to lay down
a Code of Laws which shall have the effect of correcting
the natural evils and vicious propensities of the natives
of the clime.</p>

  <p>It might, perhaps, at first sight, appear that these
remarks are not peculiarly applicable to the subject of
the present Essay; but this is by no means the case.
The object of History is to make the experience of past
ages subservient to the use of the present; and the object
of Education to enable the existing generation to take
advantage of the experience so afforded. But if that
portion of History most rich in traits of nature, most
prolific in change, most useful in developing the workings
of unsophisticated mind, be neglected, it were absurd to
imagine that the present age could derive the benefit such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
period affords from other sources, which are undeniably
less adequate to bestow it.</p>

  <p>Circumscribed, however, as a brief composition of such
a nature as the present must necessarily be, it is not
perhaps advisable to enlarge upon a point of opinion that
might admit of controversy. It may possibly be deemed
sufficient to bear out, at least partially, the position laid
down, to direct attention to the state of England at the
period of its History preceding the accession of Offa to the
crown of Mercia, and then trace briefly his mingled career
of glory and of crime.</p>

  <p>The question is not perhaps at the present day of
easy solution, whether the Jutes<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> under Hengist and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
Horsa came to Britain by invitation from the natives, or
whether their settlement in this country arose from
accidental circumstances: considering the numerical insignificance
of the expedition the latter is most probable.
Certain, however, it is, that their establishment in Kent
and the Isle of Wight led to subsequent descents upon
the coast both by Saxons and Angles, the former of
whom established themselves between A.&nbsp;D. 449 and
527 in the south and south east of the country; while the
latter, between A.&nbsp;D. 547 and 586, became located in the
northern and midland districts. It was about the last-named
date that Mercia was formed into an independent
state by Crida, comprising in its full extent what are
now the counties of Chester, Derby, Nottingham, and
Lincoln (North Mercians), Leicester (Middle Angles),
Rutland, Northampton, Huntingdon, Beds, Hertford,
Bucks, Oxon, Gloucester, Warwick, Worcester, Hereford,
Salop, and Stafford (South Mercians). To these extensive
domains,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>&mdash;extensive, that is, compared with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
other kingdoms of the Saxon Octarchy,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>&mdash;Offa, the subject
of the present Essay, succeeded in A.&nbsp;D. 755, upon the
nomination of the last king, Ethelbald, who perished at
Seggeswold in support of his throne against the powerful
rebel Bernred.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

      <p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The Jutes, Angles, and Saxons were Germanic tribes. The first of
these were from Jutland, or the Cimbric Chersonesus, in Denmark. The
Angles were a tribe of the Saxon Confederacy occupying <em>Anglen</em> in the
 south-east part of the Duchy of Sleswick in the south of Denmark.</p>
      <p>The Saxons were at first only a simple state, though the name was
afterwards applied to a confederacy of nations. Like all the Teutoni, or
Germans, they were of oriental origin. They were as far westward as the
Elbe in the days of Ptolemy (A.&nbsp;D. 90), and were, therefore, in all probability
among the first Germanic tribes that visited Europe. Their situation
between the Elbe and the Eyder, in the south of Denmark, seems to indicate
that they moved among the foremost columns of the vast Teutonic emigration.
When first settled on the Elbe they were an inconsiderable people,
but in succeeding ages increased in power and renown. About A.&nbsp;D. 240,
they united with the Francs (the Free people) to oppose the progress of the
Romans towards the north. By this league and other means the Saxon
influence was increased till they possessed the vast extent of country
embraced by the Elbe, the Sala, and the Rhine, in addition to their ancient
territory from the Elbe to the Eyder. After many of the Saxons had
migrated to Britain, the parent stock on the Continent had the name of Old
Saxons.&mdash;<i>Preface to Bosworth’s <cite>Anglo-Saxon Dictionary</cite>.</i></p>

      <p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> It is not rendered clear from the confused statements of the early
historians, whether the latter, who attempted to seize the crown, succeeded
in holding it for any length of time; but it is certain, from the language of
the venerable Bede (<cite class="plain"><abbr title=" Ecclesiastical History">Eccl. Hist.</abbr></cite> <abbr title="libri 5 capite ultimo" lang="la" xml:lang="la">l. 5. c. ult.</abbr>) as well as from other authorities,
that Offa had to contend for the diadem before he wore it, and not without
effusion of blood possessed the regal dignity.</p>
      <p>The author of the “<cite class="plain" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vita Offæ Secundi</cite>,” appended to Watts’s edition of
Matthew Paris, states, that Tuinfredus and his wife (the parents of the
subject of the Essay) were persecuted by Beormredus (Bernred), but that
he despised their youthful offspring who is described as “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">usque ad annos
adolescentiæ inutilis poplitibus contractis, et qui nec oculorum vel aurium
plenè officio naturali fungeretur</span>.” When, however, the designs of Bernred
had so far succeeded as to induce Tuinfredus and his wife to take refuge in
some distant place of security, a miraculous change took place in Pinefredus,
their son, similar to that which had, in former ages, occurred to Offa the son
of Warmund; and from a dull and feeble youth he suddenly sprang into full
possession of all his faculties, and appeared a highly-gifted man. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quid
plura? de contracto, muto, et cæco, fit elegans corporis, eloquens sermone,
acie perspicax oculorum.</span>” From this change the enraptured Mercians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
looked upon him as some divine person sent to deliver them from the
tyranny of Bernred, and called him no longer Pinefredus, but “a second
Offa!” Of this anonymous historian, however, the authority is not perhaps
of peculiar weight, neither is the miraculous change stated to have taken
place in the youthful Pinefredus especially calculated to court our unhesitating
reliance; and most of his readers will be inclined, with his editor, to
quote from Horace, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Credat Judæus Apella, non ego!</span>”</p>
      <p>Some of the annalists of the events of that period are more brief in their
 accounts of Offa’s accession. Thus,</p>

  <p>No sooner had Offa been established, not less by the
hearts of his subjects than by the acts of his power or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
will of his predecessor, upon the throne of Mercia, than
he applied himself to the duties of a barbaric sovereign,
confirming his dominions and extending the limits of his
territory. Brave and ambitious, endowed with personal
vigour and mental abilities unequalled by any of his age
and country, he gradually directed his powers against
the neighbouring sovereigns. Circumstanced as the
Saxon kingdoms in Britain were, nothing could be more
easy than to find a pretext for offence; and whether we
suppose, with the Monk of St. Alban’s, that Offa was
instigated in his ambitious views by his wife Cynedritha,
or believe that he simply acted on the defensive against
the confederate monarchs of Deira, East-Anglia, Kent,
Sussex, and Wessex, certain it is that his wars with
these opponents terminated to his glory and their disgrace.
At Feldhard in East-Anglia, the superiority of
Offa’s forces was first made manifest. Within two years
after this engagement he won the <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">spolia opima</span></em> in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
decisive conflict at Otteford, near Sevenoaks, with the
troops of Kent. And not long subsequently, he routed
the combined forces of his enemies under the command of
Cynewulf&mdash;himself a celebrated warrior&mdash;at Bensington,
or Benson, (about twelve miles on the London side of
Oxford,) the Villa Regia of the West Saxons, and dismantled
the fortifications which their monarch had in vain
striven to preserve.</p>

  <p>After such specimens of prowess on the part of the
Mercian king, it is no marvel that the kings of Deira and
of Sussex should seek a distant and friendly land as the
scene of their operations against the successful Offa.
They sought refuge and assistance at the court of
Marmodius, king of Wales; and against the Britons
accordingly Offa next directed his arms. Aided by their
native fastnesses these new opponents afforded protracted
resistance on the western boundary of his kingdom, and
with them and their Saxon allies he had many and severe
engagements. Owing to the craft of Marmodius he met
with some reverses in his first campaign, and on one
occasion narrowly escaped with his life. Eventually,
however, his good genius prevailed. He annexed to
Mercia the east of Wales as far as the Wye, planted the
subject territory with Anglo-Saxons, and built the wall
known by the name of Offa’s Dyke,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> about one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
miles in extent, from the æstuary of the Dee to the mouth
of the first-mentioned river.</p>

    <div class="footnote">

      <p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> The following is the substance of Offa’s war with the Britons, as collected
from Speed’s <cite class="plain">Chronicle</cite>. Their king at this period was Marmodius.
The West-Saxons, in their struggles with Offa, had found in Marmodius an
ally. On the discomfiture of Kenwolfe, (<abbr title="king of the West Saxons">k. of W. S.</abbr>) Offa marched to the
borders of Wales. Previous letters and explanations had passed between
the two monarchs, and the negociations were still, by the artifice of Marmodius,
prolonged. “A stratagem (in the words of our authority) to protract
time, and work upon advantage.” In this interim of compliments the
Mercian king built a fortified dyke or ditch, commencing at Basingwark in
Flintshire, and ending near Bristow at the fall of the Wye, and forming, in
its utmost length, a barrier of about one hundred miles between the two
kingdoms. “Marmodius, who openly bare saile to this wind, and seemed to
winke at Offa’s intent, secretly called a council of state, wherein he declared
how the act there in working would soon prove the bane of liberty unto their
country, and the marke of dishonour to themselves and posterity for ever,
therefore his advice was that by some stratagem it might be staid by time.”
Accordingly, having secretly collected their allies the Saxons “both of the
South, West, and North, upon St. Stephen’s day, at night, they suddenly
brake down the banke of this fortification, filling up again great part of the
ditch, and in the morning most furiously rushed into Offa his court, putting a
great number to the sword who were more intent and regardful to the feast
than to any defence from their cruel and merciless swords.” The effect of
this successful stratagem was a short superiority on the side of the Britons.
Offa’s army was routed, and himself in imminent danger. But his return
was speedy, and his revenge decisive. He made their hostages his vassals
and slaves, and entering Wales with a large army, conquered Marmodius,
“and all his associates in the field.”</p>
      <p>Mr. Hutton, who examined the remains of Offa’s dyke in 1803, says “the
traveller would pass it unheeded if not pointed out. All that remains is a
small hollow which runs along the cultivated fields, perhaps not eighteen
inches deep in the centre, nor of more than twenty yards width.”&mdash;<i><cite>Travels

  <p>In policy as in arms Offa proved himself equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
successful. When he had been about ten years on the
throne he made an attempt to deprive Iambertus, or
Lambert, Archbishop of Canterbury, of his province, and,
“contrary to the customs of antiquity,” to erect Lichfield
into an Archiepiscopate. Although the clergy and natives
of Kent were naturally opposed to an innovation which
so materially affected their ecclesiastical importance, the
king of Mercia succeeded in obtaining from Pope Adrian
the First permission to prosecute his design; and the
bishops of Worcester, Leicester, Chester, and Hereford,
and of the East-Angles Helmham with Norfolk, and
Domuck, or Donwich, with Suffolk, were, some years
later, subjected to the Bishop of Lichfield: London, however,
Rochester, Winchester, and Sherbourn remained in
the diminished province of Canterbury.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

      <p>Holinshed thus writes: “Eadulphus, bishop of Lichfield, was adorned
with the pall and taken for archbishop, having all those bishops within the
limits of king Offa his dominion suffragans unto him; namelie, Denebertus,
bishop of Worcester, Werebertus, bishop of Chester, Eadulphus, bishop of
Dorchester, Wilnardus, bishop of Hereford, Halard, bishop of Eltham and
Cedferth, Tedfrid, bishop of Donwich.” “But (as saith another writer,
Will. of Malmsbury,) this iniquity did not long deform canonical institutions.”
Kenulph, second in succession from Offa, restored Athelard, or
Ethelard, to the privileges of the See of Canterbury; and the same king in a
letter to Leo, the then reigning Pope, professes his sense of the impropriety
of Offa’s conduct, and his willingness to submit in ecclesiastical matters to
the example of antiquity and of the Pope.</p>

  <p>A correspondence, still extant, which took place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
between Offa and the emperor<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Charlemagne, serves to
throw some light on the complexion of the times; and the
fact of its existence may be deemed a valuable compliment
to the talents, the power, and the reputation of the
Anglo-Saxon. How their acquaintance commenced is
uncertain: but the fact of Alcuin, an English clergyman,
having been preceptor to the emperor is sufficient to
account for his being favorably inclined to the nation that
gave his tutor birth.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

      <p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> The anonymous biographer of Offa, who records his miraculous metamorphosis,
states that the five kings to whom Offa soon became formidable
after his elevation to the crown of Mercia, sought aid from Charles the Great
of France (probably Carloman, the brother and predecessor of Charlemagne
is meant), who promised to protect them, and wrote to Offa accordingly.
The sovereign of Mercia, however, spurned his threats, and proceeded to
effect his conquests. Carloman in the meanwhile dying, left his kingdom to
Charlemagne, to whom the five kings repeated their supplications for aid,
which was again promised, and Charlemagne wrote enjoining Offa to desist
from attacking them. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quid nobis rex transmarinus?”</span> was the lofty remark
of the Mercian king, and he proceeded undaunted in the prosecution of his
designs. Some time subsequent to these events, Offa is stated (and in this
Speeds’s <cite class="plain">Chronicle</cite> follows the Monk of St. Albans) to have written to Charlemagne
with the design of procuring his friendship and alliance; and to this
epistle he received a favourable reply, which led to a friendship and correspondence
between the two potentates. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vide</span> also <abbr title= "William of Malmesbury">Will. Malmesbury</abbr> in

  <p>The friendship of monarchs, however, from its intimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
connexion with political expediency, is necessarily unstable:
nor was that of Offa and Charlemagne without
interruption. The Frank desired the hand of a daughter
of Offa for his natural son Charles; but this the Mercian
sovereign refused unless Bertha, the daughter of the
emperor of the west, were bestowed upon Egfrid his
own son and heir. The demand excited the anger of
Charlemagne; and, in consequence, disregarding the wise
remonstrances of his council, he closed the ports of Gaul
against the merchants of Anglo-Saxon Britain.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> In consequence
of this hasty and decisive step, Offa was apprehensive
of invasion from his indignant foe, and this
anticipation of evil was increased, by the knowledge that
he afforded his powerful protection to some Anglo-Saxon
malcontents. Lambert, the Saxon Primate, was suspected
of being privy to the emperor’s designs, and this
afforded a pretext (if indeed it were not really the reason)
for removing the Archiepiscopate from Canterbury to
Lichfield. After some lapse of time, however, concord
was restored between the regal friends, through the
mediation of Alcuin and the abbot Gervald<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>. The for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>mer
of these (one of the most interesting and learned
characters of that age) had not escaped the imputation
of treasonable designs&mdash;an imputation which he repels
with great simplicity and apparent honesty in the words
addressed to a friend, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Vere Offæ regi nec genti
Anglorum <em>unquam infidelis fui</em>!”</span> His embassy from
the court of his adopted to that of his natural sovereign
was accompanied by gifts which were thus symbolically

  <p>A brief review of the Anglo-Saxon system of government
may, perhaps, be here not inapplicably inserted, in
order to convey some definite idea of Offa’s position as
the sovereign of Mercia, and enable the reader to trace
more satisfactorily the improvements which he was the
means of introducing into Britain.</p>

  <p>The prescriptive constitution of the Anglo-Saxons was
decidedly of a liberal form, and to it may be traced the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
majority of our own liberal institutions; but one most
important difference exists between the ancient and
modern constitution of Britain, in the fact of the sovereignty
of the Saxon kingdoms not being positively
hereditary. “A son who inherited his father’s virtues
and talents,” observes the author of a popular History of
Modern Europe, “was sure to succeed his sway; but if
he happened to be weak or profligate, or was a minor,
the next in blood, or the person of the greatest eminence
in the state, generally procured an elevation to the
throne.”<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

  <div class="footnotes">
    <div class="footnote">

      <p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> This practice, indeed, recognized in the laws of Offa alluded to in a
subsequent portion of the Essay, continued so late as the Norman king, John,
and the unsettled state of the doctrine of succession has been urged in
extenuation of his usurpation.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The Anglo-Saxon annals afford an excellent commentary
upon this system of a partially elective monarchy.
Scenes of strife and bloodshed, family dissensions, party
feuds, assassination, and even fratricide were not unfrequent
occurrences amid this optional “setting up and
pulling down of kings;” and the liberality and seeming
justice of the system, that appear so seductive on a first
view of the <span class="smaller">THEORY</span>, fade before the exercise of tyranny,
the right of might, and the injustice of usurpation, that
evidence themselves as its prolific offspring when reduced
to <em>practice</em>.</p>

<p>To aid the king and sanction measures of public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
administration, as well as give consent to the enactment
of laws, there existed among the Saxons an Assembly or
Parliament, termed a Wittena-Gemot, consisting of the
nobles or thanes, the dignified clergy, and freemen possessing
a given portion of land.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> There was also a
county court, termed Shire-Gemot, where all the freeholders
assembled twice in each year to receive appeals
from the inferior courts (probably the petty courts
held by each landholder for conducting the affairs of his
own estate); and over this assembly the eaorlderman
(earl) and the bishop presided, although they do not
appear to have had farther authority allotted to them
than was sufficient to keep order among the freeholders,
and to offer their advice in causes of difficulty.</p>

  <div class="footnotes">
    <div class="footnote">

      <p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Five hides were at first deemed a sufficient qualification, but the required
amount rose gradually to forty.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>To obtain nobility among the Saxons required one of
three qualifications, birth, valour, or wisdom. The parents
who had distinguished themselves by either of the latter
means transmitted their honors to their children. They
who were born of obscure or moderate parentage (provided
they were free) had, however, the path of distinction
open to them to pursue at will. They who gained their
nobility by valour were termed <em>adelingi</em>; they who
gained it by wisdom in peace (because generally the fruit
of experience) were termed <em>aldermanni</em> (senators or elder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
men); and they who gained it by a mixed valour and
wisdom in war, being illustrious for success rather than
simple courage, were termed <em>heretochii</em>.</p>

  <p>Beneath the nobles there were two distinct classes, each
capable of a subdivision; viz., the freemen, and the slaves
or villains. The freeborn (<em>frilingi</em>) were either <em>custodes
pagani</em>, country gentlemen, or simply <em>pagani</em>, ceorles or
yeomen; while the villains were distinguished as <em>lazzi</em>,
bondmen, or <em>free lazzi</em>, freedmen or manumitted slaves.</p>

  <p>Of these all except the two last had a share in the
representation of their respective states, and free access
to, if not the right of voting at, the Micklemote or
Wittena-Gemot when assembled.</p>

  <p>Whether the priests formed originally a part of the
Witan is difficult to determine, but unquestionably they
did so after Christianity was received among the Saxons;
for within six years after Augustin’s arrival (A.&nbsp;D. 597)
Ethelbert, king of Kent, having summoned a council
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tam <em>Cleri</em>, quam Populi</span>,” distinguished himself as the
promulgator of the earliest written laws of the Anglo-Saxons
which are now extant. Of the lawgivers next
following him, Hlothære and Eadric, as well as Whitræd,
little beyond their names is known; but about a century
after Ethelbert’s time, Ina promulgated a fresh and more
extensive Code of Laws, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">suasu et instituto <em>Episcoporum</em>,
omnium Senatorum et natu majorum sapientium populi;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
in magnâ servorum Dei frequentiâ</span>.” After him Offa
promulgated laws throughout his dominions, but these are
not now separately extant: and about a century later
Alfred the Great, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">consultu sapientium</span>,” retained and
confirmed all the righteous laws of Ethelbert, Ina, and
Offa, while he reformed or rescinded those enactments
which circumstances had rendered less efficient or less
advisable to be retained.</p>

  <p>“The laws of Offa,” remarks Sir Francis Palgrave,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
“have not been retained in their original form, and we
cannot distinguish them in the capitulary of the king of
Wessex. But the laws of Ina are annexed to the statute
of Alfred, and perhaps we only possess them in his
edition. There was no incorporate union of the Saxon
kingdoms, and it is, therefore, probable that there were
two promulgations of Alfred’s laws, one statute for the
West-Saxons, and to which the laws of Ina were appended,
and another for Mercia, since lost, to which the
laws of Offa were, in like manner, annexed.”</p>

  <p>It is of course with diffidence that any opinion is set
forth which seems to run counter to so eminent an
authority as Palgrave; but there does appear a plausible
reason (if not a sufficient one) for the laws of Offa not
being found under a separate title; viz., that the laws
termed those of Alfred, independent of Ina and Ethelbert,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
<em>were</em> those of Offa! This idea is corroborated by the
circumstance, that Alfred did not assume to himself so
much credit as a <em>Lawmaker</em> as a collector and improver
of laws; for in the preamble to his Code, he says that he
had selected some of its laws, with the approbation and
advice of his council, from those of <em>Offa</em> and others!</p>

  <p>The entire improvements which Offa introduced into
the legislation of his kingdom and subjected territories
are, at the present day, too difficult of discovery to be
clearly elucidated, unless the foregoing hypothesis be
adopted: but there may be excepted from this difficulty
the laws passed at the legatine council in his reign, held
at Calchythe, A.&nbsp;D. 785, when Egfrid his son was associated
with him in the government.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

      <p>Calchythe, the <em>Chelsea</em> of the present day, was the residence of Offa in the
latter part of his reign. It appears to have been chosen from its proximity
to London (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">caput regni Merciorum. <abbr title="Vide">V.</abbr></span> <abbr title="William of Malmsbury">Will.

many of the municipal laws and privileges of which may fairly be traced to
this era. The Lord Mayor, the representative of the Mercian king, is the
only individual named in the acknowledgment of a new sovereign; and his
official permission must be obtained before the proclamation can take place
in the city. These, with many other civic privileges, appear to be the
shadows of ancient royalty, standing forth amid the record of past days, the
ghostlike remnant of a once more substantial glory!</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Among these were the important enactments that no
persons of illegitimate birth should ascend the throne, or
inherit private property, and that kings should be “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a
sacerdotibus et senioribus populi eligantur</span>;” that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Nicene Creed should be adopted; that bishops should
visit their dioceses once a year; that tithes were to be
paid, but that no tributes to the church were to be larger
than was provided by the Roman law; that the rich and
powerful should judge righteous judgment; with other
provisions of minor importance.</p>

  <p>Brief as is this notice of the Anglo-Saxon government,
it is sufficient to show, that it was indebted to Offa for
alterations and improvements, which, from the security
and length of his reign, and their subsequent adoption
by the great Alfred, may be fairly conceived to have been
dictated by judgment, and enforced by a prudent exercise
of power.</p>

  <p>The first irruption of the Danes into Britain is said
to have taken place during Offa’s reign, and to have been
by him, for a time at least, successfully repressed.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> But
there is one event to which no allusion has yet been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
made, which has had greater effect in inducing posterity
to form a judgment on his character than even the repulse
of the early attacks of the <em>Vikingr</em>. An event that, if
unrecorded, would have left him an almost stainless glory,
but which, when fairly stated, leaves the painful impression
that the blot of homicide darkens his otherwise fair
escutcheon.</p>

decked for his reception, the spousal banquet spread, the

Cynedritha proposed to Offa the murder of their guest, but that he indignantly
refused; and that subsequently she prepared a device of a sinking
platform in Ethelbert’s chamber, so that when he threw himself on his
couch it sank with his weight, and he was immediately suffocated by assassins
who were on the watch in the chamber below. The difference however
in the latter part of their narratives is as follows: <abbr title="Matthew of Westminster">M. Westr.</abbr> states that
Offa secluded himself from public and refused to taste food for three days,&mdash;but
that, notwithstanding, as Ethelbert had died without heirs he despatched
a powerful force to East Anglia to take possession of the kingdom. The
Monk of St. Alban’s, in the most approved style of legendary lore, proceeds
with the history of Ethelbert’s body after his murder. He states that his
head was cut off, after suffocation, and the body and head being put into a
sack were carried away: being dark, the head rolled out unseen and unobserved,
and a blind man chancing to come that way kicked against it&mdash;he
took it up, and anointed his eyes with the <em>sacred blood</em>, and immediately his
sight was restored! Poetic justice is also dispensed to Cynedritha by this
writer: he affirms that Offa had her shut up in punishment and seclusion for
ever: that some years afterwards her place of retirement was broken in
upon by robbers for the sake of her gold and silver, and that she was precipitated
down her own well where her wretched existence was terminated.
The archbishop of Lichfield is further stated to have begged the body of
Ethelbert and buried it at Hereford, where miracles were performed by it!

blame of this foul transaction upon Offa’s queen Cynedritha;

the youthful monarch, and the subsequent and immediate
assumption of dominion over his realms by his intended

spirit of originality&mdash;the essence of causation&mdash;exists, it
<em>will</em> find a vent for its exhibition, whether it rise in the
breast of an Offa amid an age of comparative barbarism,
or burst from the mind of a Napoléon, to stalk with the
grandeur of a son of Anak superior to a host of petty
minds, narrowed by the extreme polish of that very civilization
upon which they chiefly pride themselves.</p>

  <p>Had not the genius of Offa led the way by subjecting
so large a portion of England to his control, it is scarcely
probable that Egbert would have succeeded so early as
within a few years from his decease in uniting the divided
kingdoms under his government. Nor should it be forgotten
that the future monarch of all England took his
early lessons in the rude chivalry of the times at the court
of Offa, by whom he was protected from the persecution of
Brithric:<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> thence passing in safety by the connivance of
his friend to the dominions of Charlemagne, he was entertained
by that illustrious emperor till the death of
Brithric left the kingdom of Wessex open to his claims.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
And on his return to his native land, he showed plainly
that the ambitious designs of his early protector yet lived
in his bosom, and but a transient period intervened ere
the divided House of the Octarchy owned him as their
common Lord.</p>

  <p>To Offa then, as the preserver, and to a certain extent
the instructor, of the first sole monarch of England, the
present age must look back with gratitude as the founder
of the limited monarchy of the land; but as he is said by
one of his historians<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> to have been a man in whom virtue
and vice were so mingled, as to render it difficult to say
whether of the twain were predominant&mdash;so in the legacy
of spiritual slavery which he bequeathed to his kingdom,
it is a question whether the advantages arising from unity
in political government were not more than counterbalanced.</p>

      <p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> “Offa was a man of great mind, and who would endeavour to bring to
effect what he had preconceived. He reigned thirty-nine years. When
I consider the deeds of this man I am doubtful whether I should commend
or censure. At one time, in the same character, vices were so palliated by
virtues, and at another virtues came in such quick succession upon vices,
that it is difficult to determine how to characterize the changing Proteus.”&mdash;<i>William
of Malmsbury.</i></p>
      <p>It must be remembered, however, that William of Malmsbury was an
interested party; and therefore his testimony as to Offa’s character must
be regarded as coming from a source somewhat prejudiced against him.&mdash;<i><abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Vidi">V.</abbr>

permission to transfer the province of Canterbury to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Lichfield, recognize the principle of interference in the
ecclesiastical government of this country on the part of
the bishop of Rome, but he is expressly stated to have
made his whole realm tributary to that See. And it is
certain that in paying Romescot<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> he followed the example<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
of Ina, who in the year 697 “was the first that

dwelling house that had ground thereto, occupied to the yearly value of thirty
pence, <em>excepting the lands which he had purposed for the monastery of St.
Albans</em>. This Offa had a much larger dominion than Ina, and was king over
three and twenty shires. After whom Æthelwolf passed a new grant thereof
out of his whole kingdom, which was well nigh all that part which was called
Saxony, with this proviso, nevertheless, that where a man had divers dwelling
houses he was only to pay for that house wherein he dwelt at the time

throughout the middle ages the growing foliage of superstition,
that cast its dim and lengthening shadow over the
lovely temple of religion. And when it was the received
creed of the time, that donations to the church, of which
the bishop of Rome was falsely regarded as the head,
were sufficient to compensate for the most heinous crimes,
it cannot be surprising that the regal homicide should pay
his court to the prevailing idol, or that the wide domains
of the wealthy and noble sensualist should in his dying
hour (no longer, then, of service to pander to his appetites,)
be transferred to the service of that all-powerful
agency which professed itself alike enabled to quench the
fires of purgatory and unbar the portals of the mansions of
eternal bliss! Offa, the proud and conquering king,
stripped of its vested rights the ancient province of Canterbury
to aggrandize with spiritual supremacy his own
domains<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>&mdash;Offa, the daring and ambitious prince, yielded
to the evil suggestions of tempting opportunity, and with
a bold and bloody hand seized the broad lands of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
sainted martyr Ethelbert. But Offa the pilgrim, the
penitent, the failing and remorseful monarch, over whom
the feeble halo of an earthly fame had passed and left no
bright and pleasing memory behind&mdash;Offa, who felt his
time at hand and looked through the hazy superstition of
a corrupted church upon a vision of purchasable happiness
in heaven “in testimony of repentance for the blood that
he had spilled, bestowed a tenth of all his goods on the
churchmen and on the poor,”<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> built churches, founded
abbeys, and endowed monasteries,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> to bribe the God whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
laws he had infringed, and bargain at a price for the
salvation which had been freely offered!</p>

to Lichfield) he committed other arbitrary depredations on the church.
“He seizeth on churches and other religious houses,” says Holinshed.
“A downright pilferer,” says William of Malmsbury, “he converted to his
own use the lands of many churches, of which Malmsbury was one.” Everth
(Egfrid), however, on his coming to the throne, restored to the monasteries
the possessions which had been misapplied in former reigns: and gave
Malmsbury into the hands of Cuthbert, then abbot of that place.</p>

(<i><abbr title="Matthew of Westminster">Matth. West.</abbr> A.&nbsp;D. 794</i>), his making Mercia tributary to the See of Rome
(<i>Holinshed, <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 4, <abbr title="book">b.</abbr> 6, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> 2.</i>), and his erection and endowment of St.
Albans over the body of the English protomartyr, were all subsequent to the
murder of Ethelbert. Some of his other donations to the church were as
follows: viz.&mdash;</p>
      <p>He made large gifts of land near Sandwich <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“monachis ecclesiæ Christi
Doroberniæ”</span> at the request of archbishop Iambertus, A.&nbsp;D. 773, Canterbury

      <p>He freed the abbey of Woking A.&nbsp;D. 775. “In the days of this same Offa
was an alderman of the name of Brorda who requested the king for his sake
to free his own monastery, called Woking, because he would give it to
Medhamsted and St. Peter, and the abbot that then was, whose name was
Pusa. Pusa succeeded Beonna; and the king loved him much. And the
king freed the monastery of Woking against king, against bishop, against
earl, and against all men: so that no man should have any claim there except
St. Peter and the abbot. This was done at the king’s town called Free-Richburn.”&mdash;<i><abbr title="Ingram's">Ingr.</abbr>

      <p>He was also a liberal donor to (some imagine the founder of) Westminster
Abbey. A.&nbsp;D. 785 “Offa granted ten plough-lands at Aldenham in Herts to
St. Peter’s church, ‘et plebi Domini degenti in Torneia’ (Thorney Isle, on
which the Minster was built). He also ‘collected a parcel of monks here’
and ‘repaired and enlarged the church,’ and ‘having a great reverence for
St. Peter,’ continues Sulcardus, ‘<em>he in a particular manner honoured it by
depositing there the coronation robes and regalia</em>.’ He also exempted it from
the payment of Romescot.”&mdash;<i>Neale’s Westminster Abbey, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> 1. <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 13. <abbr title="Dugdale">Dugd.</abbr>

      <p>He resettled the see of Dorchester (Oxon), which had experienced some

Canterbury thirty tributaries of land on the north side of the Thames, at a
place called Twittenham.”&mdash;<i>Lyson’s Twickenham.</i></p>
      <p>But the most important of Offa’s foundations was that of St. Alban’s abbey.
I have followed the date of Ingram’s Saxon Chronicle, Speed, and others, in
assigning 794 as the period of his death, and therefore cannot suppose the
foundation of St. Alban’s to have been later than that year, though it may
have been the year previous. (<abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Vidi">V.</abbr> <i>Storr’s <abbr title="Chronicle">Chron.</abbr></i>) From <i>Tanner’s <cite><abbr title="Notitia Monastica">Not. Mon.</abbr></cite>
(<abbr title="1">I.</abbr> Hertfordshire, <abbr class="smaller" title="1">I.</abbr>)</i> we learn that A.&nbsp;D. 793 a noble abbey for one hundred
Benedictine monks was founded by Offa. The Chronicler Speed says that in
A.&nbsp;D. 795 “Offa in honour of St. Albane, and in repentance of his sins, built
a magnificke monastery (over against Verolamium in the place then called
Holmehurst, where that protomartyr of Britaine for the constant profession
of the Faith lost his head), indowing it with lands and rich revenewes for the
maintenance of an hundred monks. Upon the first gate of entrance in stone
standeth cut a salteir argent in a field azure, and is assigned by the judicious
in Heraldry to bee the armes that he bare.”&mdash;<i>Book 7. <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 28.</i></p>
      <p>Matthew of Westminster and others assign different dates varying from
A.&nbsp;D. 793 to 797 to this foundation, and the Monk of St. Albans agrees with
<abbr title="Matthew of Westminster">Matth. West.</abbr> in recording the vision of an angel which occurred to Offa at
Bath, wherein he was instructed by the heavenly visitant to exhume and
place in a tomb worthy of him the body of St. Alban. This design he subsequently
named to the Pope, for which the Holy Pontiff commended him,
and promised to take the projected abbey of St. Alban under his especial
protection “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nullo episcopo sive archiepiscopo mediante</span>.”</p>
      <p>Speed further states, that Offa built a church in Warwickshire after his
return from Rome, “where the adjoining town from it and him beareth the
name of <em>Off-Church</em>:” and that at Bath he built “<em>another</em> monastery.” Perhaps
it is to this last, and not to St. Peter’s church which was rebuilt by
him (see <i>ante</i>), to which Dugdale refers in his <i><cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Monasticon Anglicanum">Mon. Angl.</abbr></cite></i> when he says,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Monasterium Batoniense rex Offa construxit, quod post rex Edgarus,
sicut alia monasteria reparavit.”</span></p>
      <p>To the above Holinshed adds the church of Hereford, which he states that
he “indowed with great revenues.” <i><cite><abbr title="History of England">Hist. Engl.</abbr></cite> <abbr title="book">b.</abbr> 6. <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 4.</i></p>

  <p>But with all his faults and failings, Offa was a great,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
